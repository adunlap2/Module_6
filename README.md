# :sun_behind_rain_cloud: Weather API 

:wind_face: About: For this project, 
- **Overview:**
- This project analyzes weather data obtained from the WeatherPY API to explore relationships between latitude and various weather parameters. Scatter plots are used to visualize these relationships, and linear regression models are created to examine trends. The analysis focuses on the following comparisons:

- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

- **:beach_with_umbrella:##VacationPY Project**
- **Overview:**
  - The VacationPY project utilizes data from the Weather API dataset to find local hotels near randomly selected locations. It includes functionalities to display random cities on a map plot, with each plot showing longitude and latitude coordinates when hovered over. The project also integrates the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates of each city.

- **Project Features**
- Random City Selection:
- Randomly selects cities from the Weather API dataset.
- **:world_map: Map Plotting:**
- Displays random cities on a map plot.
- Hovering over each plot shows longitude and latitude coordinates.
- **:hotel: Hotel Search:**
- Utilizes Geoapify API to find the first hotel within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates.
- **:input_numbers: Steps and Functionalities**
- Random City Selection:
- Randomly selects cities from the Weather API dataset.
- **:world_map: Map Plotting:**
- Displays the selected cities on a map plot.
- Hovering over each plot reveals longitude and latitude coordinates.
- **:hotel: Hotel Search using Geoapify API:**
- For each city, we use Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates.
- **:open_book: How to Use**
- Run the Script:
- Execute the script to run the VacationPY project.
- **:world_map: View Map Plot:**
- After running the script, view the map plot displayed with random city locations.
  Hover over each plot to see the longitude and latitude coordinates.
- **:compass: Find Local Hotels:**
- Utilizes the Geoapify API to find hotels near each randomly selected city.
  The first hotel located within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates is displayed.
